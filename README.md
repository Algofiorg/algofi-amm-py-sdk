# algofi-amm-py-sdk

To run the triangle arb example just put a .env file in the v0 folder with mnemonic =.
If the account is new and not opted into assets then uncomment the opted in portion of the example.
I just assumed for now that you would be opted in already if you were calling this function for arb bots.

Note: everything was put in the same file so that importing could be done locally rather than committing every
change to the master branch and then reinstalling the sdk. This can be changed for final product however.
